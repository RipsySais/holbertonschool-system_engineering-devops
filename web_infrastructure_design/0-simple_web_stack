Explanation
What is a server?
A server is a powerful computer that provides services, such as hosting websites and databases, to other computers over a network.

Role of the domain name
The domain name foobar.com is a human-friendly address that users enter instead of an IP address. It helps locate the server hosting the website.

DNS Record Type A
The www subdomain is an A record in DNS, which maps a domain name to an IP address—in this case, 8.8.8.8, the address of the server.

Role of the web server (Nginx)
The web server listens for HTTP requests and serves static content like images or HTML files. It also forwards requests for dynamic content to the application server.

Role of the application server
The application server runs the website’s backend code, processes business logic, communicates with the database, and generates dynamic content.

Role of the database (MySQL)
The database stores website data like user information, posts, and other structured information necessary for the application.

Communication Protocol
Servers and user browsers communicate using the HTTP protocol, which defines how requests and responses are exchanged.
