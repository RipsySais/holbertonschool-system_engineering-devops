Why each added element
Extra Load Balancer (HAProxy B)

Creates an HA (high availability) load-balancer cluster with HAProxy A, removing the load balancer as a single point of failure.

Usually configured with VRRP/Keepalived for a shared virtual IP, or DNS-level failover.

Split Components onto Dedicated Servers

Web Tier (Nginx servers): Efficiently handles HTTP termination, static files, and connection management.

Application Tier (Gunicorn/Uwsgi servers): Runs app code; stateless design allows horizontal scaling.

Database Tier (MySQL Primary/Replica): Separates persistent storage for consistency and allows read scaling via replicas.

Additional Server

Added to scale out one of the tiers (e.g., an extra web or app server) to increase capacity and reduce per-node load.

Benefits
Scalability: Each layer can scale independently (add more web or app servers).

High Availability: LB cluster avoids SPOF at the entry point; DB replica provides read redundancy and quicker failover.

Performance: Dedicated roles reduce resource contention and improve response times.

Notes
Load balancers commonly use Round Robin or Least Connections algorithms; choose based on traffic patterns.

Ensure session stickiness if your app requires it, or store session state in a shared backend (Redis).

Secure internal traffic and expose only necessary ports with firewalls.

Use monitoring and alerts for each tier to detect failures and auto-scale if possible.
